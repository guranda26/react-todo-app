# To-Do List Application

# Overview

The To-Do List Application is a simple yet powerful tool designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. It features a dual-column interface that separates active tasks from completed ones, providing clear visual guidance on task status. Users can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and manage completed tasks with ease.

# Features

Add Tasks: Users can enter new tasks using an input form. New tasks are automatically added to the "To-Do" list.
Complete Tasks: Each task in the "To-Do" list has a "Finish" button. Clicking this button moves the task to the "Completed Tasks" list.
Manage Completed Tasks: Tasks in the "Completed Tasks" list can be permanently deleted or moved back to the "To-Do" list for further action.
